Description: BreedStream is a suite of helper functions designed to streamline the workflow of plant breeding programs. From cleaning raw phenotypic data to prediction of next-generation breeding crosses and in silico hybrids, BreedStream helps improve efficiency at every stage of the breeding process. Built on the foundations of the StageWise and COMA packages, developed by Dr. Jeff Endelman (https://github.com/jendelman) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, BreedStream extends these tools to simplify their application in breeding programs. Originally developed by John Searl to support the UW-Madison Corn Breeding Programs led by Drs. Shawn Kaeppler and Natalia de Leon, BreedStream is well-suited for both public and private-sector breeding programs. Its flexible design allows other breeding groups to adopt and adapt it to their specific needs.
