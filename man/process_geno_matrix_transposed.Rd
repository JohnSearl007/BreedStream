\title{Process Genotype Data into Centered Coefficient Matrices for insilico_transposed Output}
\usage{
process_geno_matrix_transposed(
  filename,
  ploidy,
  dominance = FALSE,
  chunk_size = 125000,
  min_minor_allele = 5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{filename}{Character string specifying the path to the CSV file containing genotype data
(hybrids as rows, markers as columns). The file must include a header with "hybrid" as the first column
followed by marker columns.}

\item{ploidy}{Integer specifying the ploidy level (e.g., 2 for diploid, 4 for tetraploid).
Must be a positive even number.}

\item{dominance}{Logical indicating whether to compute dominance coefficients in addition to additive coefficients.
If \code{TRUE}, a second \code{big.matrix} is created for dominance effects. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{chunk_size}{Integer specifying the number of hybrids to process in each chunk.
Adjust this to balance memory usage and performance. Defaults to 125000.}

\item{min_minor_allele}{Integer specifying the minimum number of hybrids carrying the minor allele
required for a marker to be retained after filtering. Defaults to 5.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{coeff}: A \code{big.matrix.descriptor} pointing to the disk-based matrix of centered genotype coefficients
(rows = hybrids, columns = markers).
\item \code{coeff.D}: A \code{big.matrix.descriptor} for dominance coefficients (only included if \code{dominance = TRUE}).
\item \code{id}: A character vector of hybrid IDs.
\item \code{markers}: A character vector of kept marker names.
}
}
\description{
Reads genotype data from a CSV file generated by insilico_transposed (hybrids as rows, markers as columns),
filters markers based on minor allele count, centers genotypes around mean allele frequencies,
and optionally computes dominance coefficients. Results are stored in disk-based \code{big.matrix} objects.
Chunks are processed in parallel across multiple cores for efficiency.
}
\details{
The function processes the input CSV in two passes, parallelizing chunks across multiple CPU cores:
\enumerate{
\item \strong{First pass}: Reads the CSV in chunks of hybrids to compute per-marker statistics (sum, count, minor allele counts)
and filters markers based on \code{min_minor_allele}.
\item \strong{Second pass}: Reads the CSV again to compute centered genotype coefficients (and dominance coefficients if requested)
for kept markers, storing results in disk-based \code{big.matrix} objects.
}
Genotypes are centered by subtracting \code{ploidy * p2}, where \code{p2} is the mean genotype divided by ploidy.
Missing values are imputed with the marker's mean genotype.
Dominance coefficients are computed as:
\code{-2 * choose(ploidy, 2) * p^2 + 2 * (ploidy - 1) * p * geno - geno * (geno - 1)}.
