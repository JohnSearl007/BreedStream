The BreedStream R package was designed for primary deployment in the form of a Shiny App. This Shiny App, [`BreedStream`](https://github.com/JohnSearl007/BreedStream_App) was designed as a full end-to-end analysis and prediction pipeline for the University of Wisconsin - Madison Corn Breeding Programs led by Drs. Shawn Kaeppler and Natalia de Leon. This package represents a serious of functions primarily utilized by the aforementioned Shiny App. The functions found within the `BreedStream` R package are largely built on the foundations of the `StageWise` and `COMA` R packages, both of which were developed by Dr. Jeff Endelman at the University of Wisconsin - Madison and can be found on his [GitHub](https://github.com/jendelman). Another source for inspiration was [`SimpleMating`](https://github.com/Resende-Lab/SimpleMating) developed by the Resende Lab at the University of Florida.
