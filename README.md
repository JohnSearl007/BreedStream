BreedStream is a suite of helper functions designed to streamline the workflow of plant breeding programs. From cleaning raw phenotypic data collected by HarvestMaster-equipped plot combines to managing the allocation of nursery rows for next-generation breeding crosses, BreedStream helps improve efficiency at every stage of the breeding process.

Built on the foundations of the StageWise and COMA packages, developed by Dr. Jeff Endelman (https://github.com/jendelman) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, BreedStream extends these tools to simplify their application in breeding programs. Originally developed to support the UW-Madison Corn Breeding Programs led by Drs. Shawn Kaeppler and Natalia de Leon, BreedStream is well-suited for both public and private-sector breeding programs. Its flexible design allows other breeding groups to adopt and adapt it to their specific needs.
